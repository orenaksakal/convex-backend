# Backend Memory Resilience

Status: the maintained backend patch selects bounded jemalloc for the standard local backend build,
accounts for configured and observed memory, reclaims optional allocator and local Node state before
external admission shedding, exports a shared pressure signal for downstream owner-specific patches,
and preserves the finite cgroup limit as the hard boundary. Pressure controls are disabled by
default. Enabling reclamation, allocator trim, or shedding requires Linux; enabling a controller
also requires a readable, finite cgroup v2 memory limit.

## Problem

A self-hosted backend can retain substantial memory in several independent owners: Rust and native
allocations, free allocator arena space, V8 isolate heaps and reusable contexts, the local Node
executor, caches, thread stacks, and cgroup kernel memory. Process RSS, allocator accounting, and
cgroup usage overlap rather than forming an additive breakdown. A hard cgroup limit alone therefore
cannot identify which optional owner should be reclaimed, and external request shedding should not
be the first response when warm state can be released safely.

This patch owns the startup feasibility checks, process/allocator/cgroup telemetry, hysteretic
reclamation and external HTTP shedding, allocator trim, and the shared pressure signal. It extends
the maintained local Node generation-retirement patch with a pressure response and exposes the
signal to later owner-specific patches.

Backend memory resilience is carried as an ordered adoption composition after
[`local_node_executor_resilience`](../local_node_executor_resilience/README.md), whose generation
fencing and graceful retirement it reuses, and
[`shared_base_http_admission`](../shared_base_http_admission/README.md), whose dependency-aware HTTP
gate it extends. The primary `runtime: add backend memory resilience` commit introduces the memory
controller and owner responses. The later `node-executor: capture first-miss wedge diagnostics`
commit supplies continued watchdog checks and health-failure preemption while proactive retirement
drains. The `runtime: harden backend memory pressure` integration commit supplies effective
cgroup discovery, concurrent control sampling during trim, strict parser and configuration handling,
and corrected Node pressure-grace transitions. The later
`local_backend: build with bounded jemalloc` commit selects the standard process allocator and adds
its allocator-specific telemetry. Carry these commits in that order; the primary commit alone does
not implement the settled lifecycle contract. The composition does not require a context-reuse
patch.

## Observed allocator evidence

The allocator default is based on a measured long-running, multithreaded self-hosted backend under
a 30 GiB cgroup limit. Immediately before replacement, the process used 19.57 GiB RSS and the
cgroup used 20.85 GiB. GNU libc reported 13.75 GiB of arena space, 10.08 GiB logically free, and
123 arenas; mmap allocations were negligible. One explicit `malloc_trim(0)` reduced cgroup use by
about 6.35 GiB and took 4.122 seconds. The several-gigabyte release shows that allocator retention
was material for this workload, while the multi-second duration motivates detached trim execution
and continued pressure sampling.

The replacement process selected jemalloc with 32 automatic arenas, 33 initialized arenas in
total, a 10-second dirty-page decay, and active background purging. After about 14 minutes it used
9.52 GiB process RSS and 10.04 GiB of cgroup memory. Jemalloc reported 1.56 GiB allocated, 2.04 GiB
resident, and 3.15 GiB retained address space, leaving about 20 GiB of cgroup headroom. No OOM,
cgroup-limit, reclamation, or shedding event occurred during that interval. The container
replacement caused an approximately 17-second ingress failure interval during process handoff;
no further ingress 5xx occurred through the closing check about 14 minutes later.

These measurements support changing this maintained self-hosted build from the observed GNU libc
default to bounded jemalloc. They are not a matched long-duration allocator benchmark. The jemalloc
sample is from a fresh warming process, process RSS includes V8, caches, stacks, and other owners,
and jemalloc retained address space is not directly comparable with GNU libc logically free arena
space. Representative multi-hour and peak-load comparison must still cover RSS high-water, cgroup
headroom, CPU, page faults, request tail latency, and allocator-native release behavior.

## Pressure controller

`LOCAL_BACKEND_MEMORY_RECLAMATION_ENABLED` enables internal reclamation. It enters when finite cgroup
headroom is at or below `LOCAL_BACKEND_MEMORY_RECLAMATION_ENTER_HEADROOM_BYTES` and exits only when
headroom reaches `LOCAL_BACKEND_MEMORY_RECLAMATION_EXIT_HEADROOM_BYTES`. Defaults are 6 GiB and
8 GiB. The exit boundary must exceed the entry boundary and remain below `memory.max`.

External shedding is independently gated by
`LOCAL_BACKEND_MEMORY_PRESSURE_SHEDDING_ENABLED`, with default 3 GiB entry and 5 GiB exit headroom.
When both controllers are enabled, the reclamation entry and exit boundaries must each preserve
more headroom than the corresponding shedding boundary. Invalid relationships fail startup.

The controller samples cgroup headroom every second. On an eligible reclamation sample it starts at
most one allocator trim on a detached native worker while control sampling continues, then consumes
its completion and resamples the cgroup. It publishes the shared pressure signal only if headroom
remains below the reclamation exit condition. A slow or failed trim cannot hide a later crossing of
the external-shedding boundary. Once the blocking `malloc_trim` call starts it cannot be preempted;
the controller continues sampling, asynchronous runtime shutdown does not join the worker, and
process exit is its termination boundary. Losing the required cgroup source or observing a runtime
limit that invalidates configured thresholds triggers controlled backend shutdown rather than
silently disabling the safety dependency.

A new shared-pressure entry waits behind an in-flight trim only while headroom remains above
`LOCAL_BACKEND_MEMORY_PRESSURE_ENTER_HEADROOM_BYTES`. At or below that numeric boundary, owner
reclamation starts without waiting for trim even when external shedding is disabled. The shedding
entry value is therefore also the trim-deferral cutoff whenever reclamation is enabled. Setting it at
or above the reclamation entry removes the trim-first interval; setting it lower extends that interval.

## Allocator reclamation and telemetry

The default `jemalloc` feature selects jemalloc as the Rust global allocator and enables its
explicit process-allocator override on supported targets. On the GNU Linux self-hosted image, the
override forces the allocator entry points into the final link so V8 and other native code use
jemalloc for `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` as well. Apple builds register the jemalloc
allocator zone instead. Windows, Android, DragonFly, and targets rejected by the pinned jemalloc
retain their system allocator because the process-wide override and configuration contract is not
available on those targets. Building `local_backend` with `--no-default-features` also retains the
target's system allocator;
that control is GNU libc on the standard Linux target.

The executable exports jemalloc's platform-correct `malloc_conf` pointer. Targets with supported
background workers, including the GNU Linux self-hosted image, use
`abort_conf:true,background_thread:true,narenas:32,prof:false`. Targets where jemalloc does not
support those workers omit `background_thread:true` rather than making allocator initialization
fail. Later jemalloc configuration sources, including `/etc/malloc.conf` and the allocator
environment value `MALLOC_CONF`, can override that string at process startup. The embedded
automatic-arena default is 32; operators may set `MALLOC_CONF=narenas:<value>` from 1 through 128.
Jemalloc retains configuration errors and checks fatal handling after each nonempty source. Linux
backend startup reads the effective mallctl values and rejects disabled fatal handling for invalid
configuration, an automatic-arena limit outside 1 through 128, disabled dirty-page purging,
inactive background purging where it is supported, missing statistics or profiling support, or
enabled or active profiling. Linux telemetry reports the effective automatic-arena limit,
profiling support, initial enablement, and current activation separately. It likewise reports the
configured background-thread option separately from the current active state.

After refreshing the jemalloc statistics epoch, allocator memory telemetry reports `allocated`
(bytes allocated by the application), `active` (bytes in active application pages), `metadata`
(allocator metadata), `resident` (the allocator's upper estimate of physically resident mapped
pages), `mapped` (active extents mapped by the allocator), and `retained` (virtual address space
retained outside those mappings). These values overlap and must not be added. They also form a
different component domain from the GNU libc `mallinfo2` fields described below.

`LOCAL_BACKEND_MALLOC_TRIM_ENABLED` enables explicit glibc `malloc_trim(0)` while reclamation is
active. It requires reclamation to be enabled. A trim is evaluated only when `mallinfo2` reports at
least `LOCAL_BACKEND_MALLOC_TRIM_MIN_FREE_BYTES` of logical free space in the main arena, default
1 GiB, and no evaluation has occurred within `LOCAL_BACKEND_MALLOC_TRIM_COOLDOWN_SECS`, default 300
seconds.

`mallinfo2` reports its `arena`, `uordblks`, `fordblks`, and `keepcost` fields for the main arena, not
all glibc arenas. Its mmap fields are process-wide. The allocator memory metric publishes these as
the `arena`, `in_use`, `free`, `main_arena_top_chunk`, and `mmap` components. Neither main-arena free
space nor the top-chunk estimate proves that the same number of resident bytes can be returned, and
the Boolean `malloc_trim` result does not quantify released memory. Each completed trim therefore
records immediate signed changes in process RSS, process anonymous RSS, cgroup current usage, cgroup
anonymous memory, and main-arena free bytes. It also records duration and process page faults across
the before/after sample. Only a GNU libc Linux build accepts the glibc-only trim setting; every
other allocator build rejects it at startup instead of reporting glibc state or calling
`malloc_trim`.

Arena-count telemetry runs once every five minutes. The glibc path uses `malloc_info` with a fixed
4 MiB `fmemopen` buffer. The jemalloc path refreshes the statistics epoch, reads the current
`arenas.narenas` index limit, and counts every initialized automatic, oversize, or explicitly created
arena below that limit. Its `narenas` configuration metric is the separate automatic thread-arena
limit, not the initialized-arena count. Oversized, malformed, or unsupported output is a telemetry
failure; it cannot allocate an unbounded diagnostic buffer. Allocator sampling, arena counting, and
full process/cgroup reporting run in blocking work rather than occupying an asynchronous runtime
worker. The duration-unbounded trim uses the detached native worker described above so it cannot
hold asynchronous runtime shutdown open.

Trim failure is an optional-recovery failure. It is counted and logged, but it does not suppress the
shared pressure signal or the Node consumer. A diagnostic or allocator failure must not disable the
remaining reclamation actions while cgroup headroom is low.

## Context-reuse integration

This patch defines and publishes the process-wide pressure signal but does not add a dependency on
bounded reusable contexts. The separate
[`bounded_multi_context_reuse`](../bounded_multi_context_reuse/README.md) patch is applied on top of
this patch and consumes the signal.

When both patches are carried, each idle isolate drops its separate fresh context, evicts the
probationary resident, removes the weakest protected residents until only the two strongest remain,
and requests V8 low-memory collection after removing roots. The context patch also suppresses new
and probationary reusable admission while pressure is active and owns the corresponding cache
operation, clear-reason, and cardinality contracts.

This ordering keeps the generic memory controller useful without context reuse and keeps V8 cache
policy in the patch that owns the cache.

## Local Node reclamation

The local Node watchdog observes the same pressure signal. After continuous pressure for
`LOCAL_NODE_EXECUTOR_MEMORY_PRESSURE_GRACE_SECS`, default 60 seconds, it gracefully retires the
current generation only when a successful direct-child RSS sample is at or above
`LOCAL_NODE_EXECUTOR_MEMORY_PRESSURE_MIN_RSS_BYTES`, default 2 GiB. The pressure RSS floor must be
positive and strictly below the ordinary RSS retirement threshold.

The ordinary RSS limit remains the first proactive decision, followed by cgroup pressure, imported
package count, and generation age. Missing RSS telemetry, a smaller child, a shorter pressure
interval, or a cleared signal cannot trigger pressure retirement. The ordered composition preserves
generation fencing, admission close, active-request drain, health-failure preemption, direct-child
termination, and reaping. The new bounded retirement reason is `cgroup_pressure`.

## Observability

The patch extends the existing bounded memory families with:

- `backend_allocator_selected_info{allocator}` and
  `backend_allocator_configuration_info{component}`;
- `backend_allocator_arenas_info` and `backend_allocator_arena_telemetry_info`;
- `backend_memory_reclamation_enabled_info`, `backend_memory_reclamation_active_info`,
  `backend_memory_reclamation_headroom_threshold_bytes{boundary}`, and
  `backend_memory_reclamation_transitions_total{state}`;
- `backend_allocator_trim_enabled_info`, `backend_allocator_trim_active_info`,
  `backend_allocator_trim_configuration_info{component}`,
  `backend_allocator_trim_attempts_total{outcome}`, `backend_allocator_trim_seconds`,
  `backend_allocator_trim_memory_change_bytes{component}`, and
  `backend_allocator_trim_page_faults_total{kind}`;
- `local_node_executor_memory_pressure_active_info`,
  `local_node_executor_memory_pressure_rss_threshold_bytes`, and
  `local_node_executor_memory_pressure_grace_seconds`; and
- `cgroup_pressure` in the existing Node retirement and decision families.

Allocator labels form the closed set `jemalloc`, `glibc`, and `system`. The jemalloc configuration
components are `narenas`, `dirty_decay_ms`, `abort_on_invalid_configuration`,
`background_thread_configured`, `background_thread_active`, `statistics_supported`,
`profiling_supported`, `profiling_enabled`, and `profiling_active`.
`backend_allocator_memory_bytes{component}` uses the selected allocator's component domain described
above; values must not be compared across allocator selections without accounting for those
different definitions.

Trim outcomes are `returned_true`, `returned_false`, `unsupported`, and `sample_failure`. Falling
below the logical-free threshold does not call `malloc_trim` and does not increment an attempt
outcome. Signed result gauges retain the latest completed sample, so consumers must qualify them
with a counter increment in the observation window. Arena and allocator availability gauges
distinguish measured zero from unsupported or failed telemetry.

## Activation and verification

The reclamation, allocator-trim, and external-shedding switches default to `false`. Enabling any of
them on a non-Linux platform fails startup. Enabling either controller requires a finite cgroup v2
limit. Enabling trim additionally requires reclamation. When either controller is enabled, all four
headroom settings use strict nonnegative decimal parsing. Trim minimum free space, trim cooldown,
Node pressure RSS, and Node pressure grace must be positive. Changing the process environment
requires a backend restart.

Focused tests cover the effective jemalloc configuration, process-wide libc allocation
interposition, hysteresis, pressure-signal publication after trim evaluation, trim cooldown and
signed results, bounded live allocator arena counting, Node RSS and grace requirements, and
ordinary-RSS decision priority. Runtime verification must use emitted metrics to measure trim
latency and memory changes, owner reclamation, Node retirement, and cgroup recovery. The dependent
context patch separately tests six-entry admission, pressure
convergence to two hot protected contexts, admission suppression, and in-flight protected return.
No fixed reclaimed-byte or latency benefit is assumed.

Removing the patch restores the previous backend memory behavior. No schema or data change is
involved, but an older image does not understand the new environment variables or emit the new
metric families.
