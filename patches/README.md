# Maintained Self-Hosted Patch Set

These documents describe locally maintained, generic patches on top of `convex-backend` upstream.
They are operator adoption units, not one all-or-nothing fork. Read the owning essay before carrying
a patch, preserve its prerequisites, and verify the effective configuration and metrics after every
backend replacement.

The maintained backend source chain normally keeps each product patch in its own operator-adoption
commit; repository-maintenance commits can remain separate. When lifecycle ownership spans patches,
an explicitly ordered corrective integration commit may complete several earlier adoption commits;
the owning essays identify those compositions. Lane-aware queueing and its optional deployment
extension are one queue-control patch. The matching degradable-query client half is maintained in
`convex-js`; it shares the protocol and adoption essay but is not another commit in this backend
chain.

## Database connection reliability

### [Cancellation-safe MySQL connections](cancellation_safe_mysql_connections/README.md)

- Purpose: discard interrupted pooled MySQL connections, with optional server-side cancellation
  through dedicated control capacity on an operator-asserted trusted topology.
- Prerequisites: MySQL persistence; no runtime scheduler or function-execution patch.
- Activation: cancel-safe ownership and client force-disconnect of canceled or incomplete
  connections are automatic for direct MySQL operations and lease-owned transactions. In the
  default untrusted-topology mode, cancellation force-closes the client connection and never sends
  numeric `KILL CONNECTION`. Server-side cancellation requires the strict
  `MYSQL_SERVER_SIDE_CANCELLATION_TRUSTED_SINGLE_NAMESPACE=true` operator assertion described in
  the patch essay.
- Rollback: restore the upstream connection wrapper only after confirming that canceled operations
  cannot leave pending statements or reusable unread responses.

### [Cancellation-safe PostgreSQL connections](cancellation_safe_postgres_connections/README.md)

- Purpose: poison an interrupted PostgreSQL connection and issue an independent protocol cancel
  request when its owning future or result stream is dropped.
- Prerequisites: PostgreSQL persistence; no runtime scheduler or function-execution patch.
- Activation: automatic for PostgreSQL persistence after backend rollout.
- Rollback: restore the prior backend only after accepting that canceled statements may continue
  and their clients may return to the idle pool.

## Snapshot and import reliability

### [Materialize snapshot import ZIPs](snapshot_import_zip_materialization/README.md)

- Purpose: download a remote ZIP once, verify its length, and parse entries from a retained local
  file instead of provider-backed range streams.
- Prerequisites: enough local temporary disk for the archive; none of the runtime scheduler patches.
- Activation: automatic for ZIP snapshot imports after applying the patch.
- Rollback: restore the upstream streaming importer only after confirming the object store path is
  reliable for seek-heavy ZIP parsing.

### [Repair failed snapshot import checkpoints](snapshot_import_checkpoint_repair/README.md)

- Purpose: dry-run and explicitly finalize a failed replace-all import whose checkpoint tablets are
  complete.
- Prerequisites: a qualifying failed import and privileged operator permission. ZIP materialization
  is complementary but not required once valid checkpoints exist.
- Activation: only through the privileged repair endpoint; dry-run is the default.
- Rollback: do not execute a stale plan. There is no generic undo after destructive finalization.

## Schema reliability

### [Isolate schema-validation progress OCC](schema_validation_progress_occ/README.md)

- Purpose: prevent progress checkpoints from repeatedly aborting app writes that fail a pending
  schema while preserving schema-state fencing, bounded restart/history cleanup, and dashboard
  progress.
- Prerequisites: deploy the matching dashboard zero-total guard before the backend, or upgrade the
  backend and dashboard together.
- Activation: automatic during schema validation after the coordinated backend/dashboard rollout.
- Rollback: restore the backend before the dashboard; no data or configuration rollback is
  required, but the previous backend restores the original contention risk.

## Log privacy

### [Redact validator values from external log sinks](validation_error_log_redaction/README.md)

- Purpose: retain validator-error classification without sending rejected arguments, return
  values, or validator details to durable external log sinks.
- Prerequisites: none.
- Activation: automatic after deploying the patched backend image; historical events are unchanged.
- Rollback: an upstream image without equivalent redaction restores the sensitive-value leak.

## Backend memory resilience

### [Backend memory resilience](backend_memory_resilience/README.md)

- Purpose: account for configured and observed backend memory, reclaim optional allocator and local
  Node state before external HTTP shedding, select bounded jemalloc in the standard backend build,
  export a shared pressure signal for owner-specific patches, and preserve finite cgroup limits as
  the hard boundary.
- Prerequisites: local Node executor resilience for pressure-triggered generation retirement and
  shared-base HTTP admission for dependency-preserving external shedding. Pressure control also
  requires Linux cgroup v2 with a finite readable memory limit; explicit allocator trim requires a
  GNU libc control build. Arena counting is available for GNU libc and jemalloc builds.
- Activation: jemalloc is the default `local_backend` feature; a GNU libc control build uses
  `--no-default-features`. All pressure switches default to disabled. Internal reclamation,
  allocator trim, and external shedding have separate enable switches and ordered headroom
  thresholds documented in the patch essay. The shedding-entry value also bounds trim deferral
  while reclamation is enabled.
- Rollback: restore the previous backend image and remove settings it does not understand; no schema
  or data change is required.

## Build and runtime packaging

### [Backend build improvements](backend_build_improvements/README.md)

- Purpose: centralize compiler and code-generation prerequisites; honor the selected Cargo profile,
  debuginfo, and strip behavior; use shallow locked Cargo Git dependencies and shared build caches;
  and avoid a redundant eager JavaScript install and unrelated browser download.
- Prerequisites: the pinned Rust, protoc, pnpm, and Turbo tools. Image builds additionally require
  the BuildKit cache-mount support already used by the backend Dockerfile.
- Activation: local Cargo commands use `scripts/run_cargo.sh`. Default image builds remain release
  builds; dependency caching and source layering are automatic, while custom artifact behavior
  requires build args or Cargo profile settings.
- Rollback: return to the normal release profile and default strip behavior, or restore the previous
  dependency-fetch and JavaScript-install layers. Runtime behavior and data are unchanged.

### [Atomic Node executor source packages](atomic_node_executor_source_packages/README.md)

- Purpose: publish source and external packages atomically, bound their retained filesystem and
  stack-root lifetime without deleting active trees, and keep concurrent external-dependency builds
  private, output-size- and time-bounded, and responsive to the local event-loop watchdog. On Unix,
  an npm supervisor also attempts to stop its process group if the Node executor generation exits.
- Prerequisites: none.
- Activation: automatic in the local Node executor.
- Rollback: restore upstream only if atomic publication, active package ownership, bounded
  retirement, direct stack-root lookup, and watchdog-safe dependency building are all replaced.

### [Local Node executor resilience](local_node_executor_resilience/README.md)

- Purpose: retire a selected local Node generation on request/stream timeout, transport failure,
  a process-declared exit, repeated event-loop health failure, or backend shutdown; bound startup
  probes and local response streaming; prevent child stdio from bypassing function-log handling;
  terminate and reap only that direct child; and expose bounded lifecycle and health metrics.
  Proactive RSS, imported-package, and age thresholds close admission while watchdog checks
  continue, so unhealthy retirement can preempt a stuck drain. Backend memory resilience extends
  the same mechanism with cgroup-pressure retirement. This patch also moves the local runtime to
  Node.js 24 and captures bounded
  active-request, process, diagnostic-report, and main-thread CPU-profile evidence on the first
  watchdog miss without delaying replacement. Published diagnostic artifacts are private,
  retained local files rather than logs. Detached descendant process groups, including
  `build_deps` npm installs, require separate ownership. The atomic-package patch adds best-effort
  npm process-group containment, but Rust does not wait for descendant exit before removing a
  generation tempdir.
- Prerequisites: none for generation recovery, RSS/package/age retirement, or diagnostics. The
  atomic-package patch adds package and stack aggregate metrics to the same health protocol; backend
  memory resilience adds cgroup-pressure retirement.
- Activation: automatic in the local Node executor. Set
  `LOCAL_NODE_EXECUTOR_DIAGNOSTICS_DIR` to an absolute mounted path when first-miss artifacts must
  survive container replacement.
- Rollback: restore the previous backend image if healthy generations are retired unexpectedly.

## Scheduler, admission, and queueing

### [Dependency capacity](dependency_capacity/README.md)

- Purpose: propagate ancestor-unblocking ownership and allow only dependencies to use bounded
  application, queue, and worker overflow; cap independent action shells.
- Prerequisites: none within this patch set.
- Activation: carrying the patch enables its finite model. Operators must choose coherent worker,
  reserve, action, queue, and active-thread settings.
- Rollback: restore the prior image and capacity settings together; removing it restores the
  action/descendant capacity inversion.

### [Shared-base HTTP admission](shared_base_http_admission/README.md)

- Purpose: make both local HTTP gates configurable and preserve bounded main-service headroom for
  authenticated Node callbacks.
- Prerequisites: none, although Node chains normally also need dependency capacity downstream.
- Activation: carrying the patch replaces the old local fixed gates; explicit total and reserve
  values are recommended because the unset total uses the common backend default.
- Rollback: lower external proxy concurrency before restoring a smaller backend gate.

### [Isolate queue delay control and deployment lane](isolate_queue_control/README.md)

- Purpose: add bounded per-lane delay control, dependency-safe shedding, finite hard expiry, and an
  optional typed analysis/evaluation lane.
- Prerequisites: dependency-capacity scheduling and its propagated request properties.
- Activation: lane-aware queueing is disabled by default. The deployment lane is a second opt-in and
  refuses to start unless lane-aware queueing is enabled with coherent caps and deadlines.
- Rollback: disable the deployment lane first, then lane-aware queueing if necessary; both require a
  backend restart and leave the dependency-capacity patch intact.

### [Scheduled action admission before durable claim](scheduled_action_admission/README.md)

- Purpose: admit scheduled and cron actions to environment-specific execution capacity before
  committing their monotonic at-most-once `Pending -> InProgress` claim.
- Prerequisites: the maintained dependency-capacity and isolate queue-control commits; lane-aware
  queueing may remain disabled.
- Activation: automatic for scheduled and cron actions after the patched backend starts; no new
  knob or data migration is required.
- Rollback: restore the prior backend image. Existing `InProgress` jobs retain conservative
  at-most-once recovery, and must not be moved back to `Pending`.

### [Runtime health dashboard semantics](runtime_health_dashboard/README.md)

- Purpose: report observed queueing without unsupported saturation claims and display
  scheduled-function lag with second-level resolution, correct ready-state sampling, and direct
  ordinary scheduler admission-lag telemetry.
- Prerequisites: none. The backend and dashboard halves are compatible with staggered rollout but
  give the clearest result together.
- Activation: automatic after deploying the corresponding backend and dashboard artifacts.
- Rollback: restore either artifact; an older backend can still extrapolate stale ready time, and an
  older dashboard retains minute rounding.

## Context reuse

### [Cancellation-safe database context reuse](cancellation_safe_database_context_reuse/README.md)

- Purpose: preserve upstream module-wide query and mutation reuse while preventing canceled or
  visibly terminated executions from publishing a context.
- Prerequisites: application source review for every marked entry module.
- Activation: application modules opt in with `experimental_reuseContext`; the backend never carries
  a deployment module allowlist.
- Rollback: remove the marker from every opted-in module, deploy those application changes, and
  restart backend workers to clear process-local cached contexts before restoring traffic.

### [Context reuse observability](context_reuse_observability/README.md)

- Purpose: expose bounded effective-decision, lookup, validation, take/save/clear, affinity,
  occupancy, shared ownership/capacity, and isolate-memory signals.
- Prerequisites: none for metrics; it is most useful with one of the context-reuse patches.
- Activation: automatic after backend rollout. Absent series can be valid when no matching context
  activity occurred.
- Rollback: remove the patch; runtime context policy is otherwise unchanged.

### [Bounded multi-context reuse](bounded_multi_context_reuse/README.md)

- Purpose: retain one probationary plus five protected reusable contexts per isolate by default,
  make the protected count configurable, bound total resident ownership, evict incrementally under
  isolate-heap pressure, prune to the two strongest protected entries under backend cgroup pressure,
  and make worker creation follow concurrency instead of cache-key diversity.
- Prerequisites: backend memory resilience, context-reuse observability, and the relevant
  database-UDF or HTTP reuse safety patch. Application entry graphs still require source-purity
  review.
- Activation: automatic for eligible reusable contexts after backend rollout. The strict
  `ISOLATE_CONTEXT_CACHE_PROTECTED_RESIDENTS_PER_ISOLATE` knob changes the protected segment, and
  the optional `ISOLATE_CONTEXT_CACHE_MAX_RESIDENTS` knob can lower the scheduler-pool bound.
- Rollback: restore the one-slot backend image and restart to destroy multi-entry worker caches; no
  schema or data rollback is required.

### [HTTP action context reuse](reuse_http_action_contexts/README.md)

- Purpose: reuse V8 contexts for hot HTTP action modules while reinstalling per-request Rust state.
- Prerequisites: source-purity review of every reachable HTTP action module graph. Context reuse
  observability is strongly recommended.
- Activation: disabled by default through `REUSE_HTTP_ACTION_CONTEXTS=false`.
- Rollback: disable the knob and restart to clear worker-local contexts.

## Degradable client behavior

### [Degradable reactive queries and client backpressure](degradable_reactive_queries/README.md)

- Purpose: let a cooperating sync connection opt root reactive queries down into a finite cache-miss
  leader cap and receive a typed pressure lifecycle for visible stale state and epoch-scoped retry.
- Prerequisites: matching `convex-backend` and `convex-js` wire support. Stale presentation and
  optional imperative-read suppression remain explicit frontend policy; successful reactive
  subscriptions stay mounted.
- Activation: backend admission is inert while
  `APPLICATION_MAX_CONCURRENT_DEGRADABLE_QUERY_LEADERS` is unset. Clients must explicitly send the
  degradable declaration; normal clients, mutations, actions, and dependencies remain normal.
- Rollback: remove the application opt-in first, then unset the backend cap. The protocol fields can
  remain deployed inertly.

The short HTTP-action note in this essay is future work, not part of the current implementation.

## Detailed design references

These files preserve the full earlier analysis without creating additional operator adoption units:

- [Combined dependency and HTTP capacity design](dependency_capacity/design_reference.md)
  retains the benchmark tables, full stage model, metrics interpretation, and application coverage
  matrix that preceded the two concise adoption essays.
- [Deployment control-plane lane design](isolate_queue_control/deployment_lane_design_reference.md) retains
  the complete classifier, FIFO and reserve proof, deferred worker-reservation design, rejected
  alternatives, and test matrix.
- [Database context cancellation design](cancellation_safe_database_context_reuse/cancellation_design_reference.md)
  retains the full signal ownership, memory ordering, nested-call, timing, and save-boundary analysis.

## Recommended rollout order

1. Apply standalone import, build, and Node-package reliability fixes as needed.
2. Deploy dependency capacity before lane-aware queueing or the deployment lane.
3. Deploy scheduled-action pre-claim admission after those scheduler patches; it protects both the
   legacy CoDel and lane-aware queue paths.
4. Add shared-base HTTP admission when Node callbacks need outer-service headroom; size it from its
   own wait and occupancy signals.
5. Establish observability before enabling application context-reuse markers or HTTP reuse.
6. Enable reviewed database-UDF context reuse in application-owned stages; consider prewarming only
   after cold-miss evidence.
7. Deliver matching backend and client protocol before enabling degradable frontend behavior.
8. Change one independent capacity or semantic opt-in at a time unless the documented policy
   explicitly requires a coupled rollout and rollback order.

Do not use module, function, route, client, deployment, or tenant names in generic backend logic or
metric labels. Application modules may opt into application-owned semantics; route policy belongs at
the reverse proxy when it is inherently deployment-specific.
